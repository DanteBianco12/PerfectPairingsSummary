# Perfect Pairings

By Dante Bianco

Inspired by Andre and Tenaya Darlington's book "Booze and Vinyl", Perfect Pairings seeks to pair your favorite albums with delicious cocktails and/or food.

## The website is currently a work-in-progress and makes use of the Spotify API.

At this moment in time, you can search for your favorite artist, or any artist, that is on Spotify. It will then display all of the albums that artist has
listed on Spotify.

### My plans going forward are to:
- Edit the Styling (including adding a background image)
- Create a Database that links each album to a food/drink pairing
- Add Spotify User Authentication so people can view their favorite artists, albums, and songs, according to their Spotify data.
